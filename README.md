# XFEL-DAQ-UI 



## Getting started

This is a user-interface for the Taskomat sequence recording electron diagnostics using DOOCS DAQ and photon diagnostics using Karabo DAQ.

## Add your contribution in the BKR

git add.
git commit -m 'Message here what changes you are committing'
git push -uf origin main
```

## Description
Change the measurement time, undulators measured and k-ranges. The tool can start the Taskomat measurement sequence as well, and log the result in the logbook at the end.


## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
